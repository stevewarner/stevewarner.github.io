	<div id="div03">
	Soon-to-be Penn State grad, studying Information & Cyber Security. I design websites, build computers, and collect guitars. I am pursuing a career in front end development. My passions are music and technology, I hope to merge the two in my career. I have experience in business development. I recently worked as an intern building websites for local businesses. In my spare time I write and produce music. On weekends I play bass in a classic rock cover band.
